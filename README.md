# 🧠 Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction is a deep learning-based classification model designed to detect different stages of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI scans. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful features and make accurate predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Preprocessing of MRI images  
✅ Feature extraction and augmentation  
✅ Deep learning-based classification using CNNs  
✅ Performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics  
✅ Visualizations for better interpretability  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of MRI scans labeled into different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation are applied to enhance model performance.  

## 🏗 Model Architecture  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction  
- **Batch Normalization & Dropout** for regularization  
- **Softmax Activation** for multi-class classification  
- **Cross-Entropy Loss Function** for optimization
